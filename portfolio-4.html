                        For the final project in the Code Institute course, I wanted to create something personal and important to me and my future as a Software Developer. 
                        I have been a hugely creative individual my whole life, and have worked in the past as a freelance Graphic Designer and Digital Marketer through the 
                        moniker of Robert Clark Design.
                        <br><br>
                        Robert Clark Design is a full stack website that showcases a portfolio of design and development projects. The purpose is to demonstrate the work and 
                        skillset of the site user in an inviting and stylish way in order to encourage site visitors to request and purchase an array of available products, 
                        or purchase a commission package. Once a user has purchased a product, they will be able to log in via the email and password and view their order history, 
                        or if they purchased a commission package, they will be able to upload images for reference. The site owner will be able to access uploaded images for the 
                        commission. Once the commission is complete, the customer will be invited to leave a testimonial which will display on the site.
                        <br><br>
                        As a side note as I'm aware it might seem strange that I created a full portfolio project only to sideline it to a section in this portfolio, however as I 
                        included the shop functionality in the project that showcases the use of order models and Stripe payments, I didn't want to remove these complex elements just
                        so that the site as a whole could be used. So instead, we have a case of portfolio-inception, so please enjoy both.
                        <br><br>
                        Information on features, technologies used, testing and deployment can be found on the project's GitHub page.
